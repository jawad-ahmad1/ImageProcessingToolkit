# Image Processing Toolkit

A comprehensive **Image Processing Toolkit** developed in Google Colab, providing a variety of image processing, feature extraction, object detection, and machine learning techniques for analyzing images.  

> **Note:** GitHub may not render Colab notebooks properly if outputs are large. **Best practice:** download the repository and open the notebook in **Google Colab** for full functionality and visualization.

## Features

### 1. Basic Image Processing
- Grayscale conversion
- Histogram equalization
- Gaussian blur for smoothing and noise reduction
- Image sharpening for edge enhancement
- Edge detection using **Sobel** and **Canny**

### 2. Advanced Image Processing
- Morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening, closing
- Thresholding: simple & **Otsu's**
- Color space conversions: **HSV**, **LAB**
- Fourier Transform analysis for frequency-domain understanding

### 3. Feature Extraction
- SIFT & ORB keypoints and descriptors
- HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features

### 4. Object Detection
- Feature matching with SIFT + FLANN
- Template matching
- Homography-based bounding box detection

### 5. Machine Learning Integration
- Pre-trained **ResNet50** model for image classification

### 6. User Interface
- Web-based UI using **Gradio**
- Tabbed interface for image processing, detection, and classification

### 7. Code Organization & Visualization
- All functions consolidated for reusability
- Enhanced visualizations for feature matching, histograms, and outputs
