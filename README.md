# Image Processing Toolkit

This repository contains an Image Processing Toolkit built in Python using OpenCV and other libraries. 

## Features

- Basic image processing: grayscale, histogram equalization, blur, sharpening, edge detection
- Advanced techniques: morphological operations, thresholding, color space conversion, Fourier transforms
- Feature extraction: SIFT, ORB, HOG
- Object detection: feature matching, template matching
- Machine learning: image classification using pre-trained ResNet50
- User interface: Gradio-based interactive interface

All processed images are saved in the `results/` folder.
